# OLA-Data-Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing ride-hailing data from OLA to uncover valuable insights that can help optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance revenue generation. By leveraging SQL, Excel, and Power BI, I was able to process, visualize, and interpret data to provide actionable recommendations for OLA's business.

Goals
To analyze key performance indicators such as booking trends, ride distances, ratings, and cancellations.
To identify customer behavior patterns and driver performance metrics.
To discover factors affecting ride cancellations and incomplete bookings.
To explore payment preferences and their impact on revenue.
To create interactive dashboards for better data visualization and decision-making.
Business Needs
The project was driven by OLAâ€™s need to:

Understand customer and driver behaviors to improve service quality.
Minimize cancellations and incomplete rides to maximize revenue.
Identify trends in booking volumes and vehicle usage for better resource allocation.
Evaluate the performance of vehicle types to optimize fleet management.
Analyze the impact of payment methods and ratings to develop targeted marketing campaigns.
Tools and Techniques Used
1. SQL
I used SQL to extract and transform data by answering critical business questions:

Analyzed successful bookings, ride distances, and customer behaviors.
Identified cancellation trends by customers and drivers.
Segmented data by vehicle type, payment methods, and ratings to uncover insights.
2. Excel
Processed raw data and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Created pivot tables for aggregating data (e.g., ride distances, cancellation counts).
Used Excel functions to validate and clean data before visualization.
3. Power BI
Designed interactive dashboards to visualize booking trends, revenue breakdowns, and ride distributions.
Developed charts for customer vs. driver ratings, reasons for cancellations, and top-performing customers.
Incorporated drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
Methodology
Data Discovery & Cleaning
Loaded raw data into SQL and Excel.
Cleaned data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent formats.
Data Analysis (SQL)
Wrote SQL queries to answer specific business questions, such as identifying top customers, calculating average ratings, and analyzing cancellations.
Extracted insights on ride distances, vehicle usage, and payment preferences.
Visualization (Power BI)
Imported processed data into Power BI to create interactive reports.
Used visuals like line graphs, bar charts, and pie charts to highlight trends and insights.
Key Insights and Outcomes
Booking Trends
Identified peak booking hours and seasonal ride volumes, helping optimize fleet allocation.
Ride Distance Analysis
Found that certain vehicle types (e.g., Prime Sedans) were preferred for long-distance rides, guiding pricing strategies.
Customer Behavior
Discovered that UPI was the most popular payment method, suggesting a focus on digital payment campaigns.
Cancellations and Incomplete Rides
Pinpointed common reasons for ride cancellations, enabling targeted interventions to reduce lost revenue.
Ratings Analysis
Highlighted a gap between driver and customer ratings, suggesting the need for training programs or incentives for drivers.
Revenue Insights
Identified top customers and high-revenue vehicle types, helping design loyalty programs.
Conclusion
The OLA Data Analytics project provided actionable insights to enhance operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue generation. By combining SQL for data extraction, Excel for analysis, and Power BI for visualization, the project offered a comprehensive overview of OLA's business performance.

This project highlights my ability to work with large datasets, derive meaningful insights, and present them through clear, impactful visualizations.
